This is\r\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\r\n *\r\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\r\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\r\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\r\n *      been executed.\r\n *\r\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\r\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\r\n *\r\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\r\n *\r\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\r\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\r\n *\r\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\r\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\r\n *\r\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\r\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\r\n *\r\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\r\n *\r\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\r\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\r\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\r\n *\r\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\r\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\r\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\r\n *     }\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\r\n *\r\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\r\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\r\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\r\n *\r\n *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\r\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\r\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\r\n *     }\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\r\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\r\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\r\n * needs to query its data.\r\n *\r\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\r\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\r\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\r\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\r\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\r\n *\r\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\r\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\r\n *     }\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\r\n *\r\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\r\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\r\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\r\n *         case 'country-update':\r\n *         case 'city-update':\r\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\r\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\r\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\r\n *           break;\r\n *     }\r\n *   });\r\n *\r\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\r\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\r\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\r\n */\r\n\r\nvar Dispatcher = (function () {\r\n  function Dispatcher() {\r\n    _classCallCheck(this, Dispatcher);\r\n\r\n    this._callbacks = {};\r\n    this._isDispatching = false;\r\n    this._isHandled = {};\r\n    this._isPending = {};\r\n    this._lastID = 1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.
